### Checkout Time for Users

Below, you can see that most bike riders chekout out bike as early as possible. You see a significant spike within the first 20 minutes of the day while the rest of the day settles down

### Checkout Time by Gender
To correlate with the previous graph, we can see tha majority of the users are male. Males count for more than half the users that checkout within the first 20 minutes

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
Although, majority of the bikes are checked out as early as midnight, most bike riders are cycling from 8am to 6pm. Saturday has more hours of the days where users are cycling, meanwhile during the weekday, most cyclers are out between the hours of 5pm-6pm

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
As you can see below, we are able to breakdown that usage time during the weekday by gender. Male bike riders are cycling during those times frames mentioned earlier, while the average female use is remains constant and stead throughout the week.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
To filter down the results by days and also by subsribers, you can see that more subscribers are cycling and involved with program than our day to day customers. This graph should demonstrate the commitment cyclers have to the program

# Summary
After analyzing the data, not only were we able to present a demographic view to present to investors, I believe there is data missing that would help them with a decision. I recommend creating visualizations for revenue that is generated by gender at checkout. Investors have a similar factor and that is the Art of making a profit. Is this benefical for both the investor and the consumer. Eliminate the questions before they arise. We have to aesthetically present their operating cost and turnaround.
